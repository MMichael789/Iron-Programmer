# Iron Programmer

A program for a small competition at school.

It is a text-based RPG written in a sort of imperative style, not in OOP because not all members know that paradigm well enough, even though an RPG begs for the usage of OOP. (Battle system only for now) Made in Python 2.7.13 using the module "random."<br/>

Developers: Michael S David, Ethan Kissoon, Michael Baboulas.
